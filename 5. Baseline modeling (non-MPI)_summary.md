**Step 5 – Baseline Modeling**  
_Analysis of Co-variation (RQ1) and COVID Structural Break (RQ3)_  
In this part of the project, my goal was to build baseline statistical models that help us understand two questions:  
(1) how obesity, smoking, and diabetes are related across U.S. states, and  
(2) whether COVID years show any noticeable shift in these indicators.  
To do this, I used the cleaned state–year dataset created in earlier steps and transformed it into a wide-format table where each row represents a state-year combination with three main indicators: obesity, smoking, and diabetes. This gave me a clean modeling dataset for running correlation analysis, regression models, and structural break tests.  
**RQ1 – How strongly do obesity, smoking, and diabetes co-vary?**  
The first thing I checked was the simple correlation between the three indicators. Obesity showed a moderate positive correlation with both smoking and diabetes. The correlations were around 0.56–0.58, which means that states and years with higher smoking or diabetes tend to also have higher obesity levels. The relationship between smoking and diabetes themselves was weaker (around 0.22), but still positive.  
Next, I fit regression models to quantify how these variables relate when considered together. When predicting obesity using smoking and diabetes, both predictors had positive coefficients: smoking contributed roughly +0.45 percentage points to obesity for every 1% increase, and diabetes contributed about +0.87 points. The model explained around 50% of the variation in obesity across states and years, which is a reasonable baseline for such health surveillance data.  
To make sure these conclusions weren’t tied to a single model, I also compared a few baseline regressors: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Random Forest performed the best among these, with a slightly higher R² (~0.56) and lower test MSE. However, the interpretations remain clearest with the linear model, so I treat that as the main model for answering RQ1 and the tree models as supporting evidence.  
**Overall conclusion for RQ1:**  
Obesity, smoking, and diabetes do co-vary in a meaningful way across U.S. states. Obesity moves closely with both smoking and diabetes, and statistical models confirm these relationships are moderately strong and consistent.  
**RQ3 – Did COVID years create a structural break?**  
To study the COVID impact, I first created a `covid_flag` variable that marks years from 2020 onward. I then compared average indicator values before COVID (2019 or all pre-2020 years) against their values during COVID (2020–2021).  
Across both the broad (pre-2020 vs 2020+) and narrow (2019 vs 2020–2021) comparisons, the pattern was very clear:  

- **Smoking dropped noticeably during COVID**.  
    

The drop was statistically significant in both tests, with p-values < 0.05.  

- **Obesity increased slightly but not significantly**.  
    

The mean difference was less than a percentage point and not statistically different.  

- **Diabetes also showed a small, non-significant increase**.  
    

To reinforce this, I ran simple OLS regressions of the form:  
`indicator = β0 + β1 * covid_flag`.  
The coefficients told the same story: a significant decrease in smoking during COVID, and small, non-significant increases for obesity and diabetes. The regression R² values were low, but that is expected because a single dummy variable cannot capture the full variation across states.  
As an extra check, I ran Random Forest and XGBoost using the COVID flag as the only input feature. These models performed similarly poorly (near-zero or slightly negative R²), confirming that COVID alone is not enough to predict the indicator values, which again reinforces that the regression is mainly useful for estimating the COVID shift rather than explaining overall variability.  
**Overall conclusion for RQ3:**  
Among the three indicators, only smoking shows a clear and statistically significant structural break during COVID years. Obesity and diabetes show small changes but nothing strong enough to be statistically meaningful.  
**Overall Summary of Step 5**  
Across all models and tests, the results are consistent and easy to interpret:  

- **RQ1:**  
    

Obesity co-varies moderately with both smoking and diabetes.  
Linear regression shows meaningful and positive relationships, and Random Forest improves prediction slightly but doesn’t alter the interpretation.  

- **RQ3:**  
    

Smoking dropped significantly during COVID across U.S. states.  
Obesity and diabetes remained fairly stable, with only small, non-significant increases.  
This baseline modeling step completes the quantitative foundation for the rest of the project. It establishes the main relationships between the indicators and provides a clear statistical answer to whether COVID caused any shifts in chronic disease patterns.
