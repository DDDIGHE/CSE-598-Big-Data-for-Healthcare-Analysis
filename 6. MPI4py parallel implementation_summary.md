**Step 6 – MPI4py Parallel Implementation**
_Bootstrap Confidence Intervals for RQ1 and RQ3_

In this step, I reimplemented the statistical analysis from Step 5 using MPI4py to enable parallel computation. The goal was to add bootstrap confidence intervals to the correlation and regression results, providing a measure of statistical uncertainty that was not available in the baseline modeling.

**RQ1 – Co-variation of Obesity, Smoking, and Diabetes**

The bootstrap analysis confirms the findings from Step 5 with added confidence intervals:

_Pairwise Correlations (95% CI):_
| Variable Pair | Point Estimate | 95% CI |
|---------------|----------------|--------|
| Obesity vs Smoking | 0.611 | [0.524, 0.689] |
| Obesity vs Diabetes | 0.681 | [0.607, 0.745] |
| Smoking vs Diabetes | 0.360 | [0.236, 0.475] |

All correlations are statistically significant (CIs do not include zero), confirming that obesity, smoking, and diabetes co-vary meaningfully across U.S. states.

_Regression: obesity ~ smoking + diabetes (95% CI):_
| Coefficient | Point Estimate | 95% CI |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Intercept | 12.49 | [9.94, 14.64] |
| Beta (smoking) | 0.44 | [0.34, 0.54] |
| Beta (diabetes) | 1.16 | [0.97, 1.36] |
| R-squared | 0.62 | [0.54, 0.69] |

Both smoking and diabetes are significant predictors of obesity. The model explains approximately 62% of the variance in obesity prevalence across states.

**RQ3 – COVID Structural Break Analysis**

The bootstrap analysis provides confidence intervals for the mean differences between pre-COVID (2019) and COVID periods (2020+):

_Mean Difference: COVID - Pre-COVID (95% CI):_
| Indicator | Mean Difference | 95% CI | Significant? |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| Obesity | +0.73 | [-0.65, 2.11] | No |
| Smoking | **-2.16** | [-3.42, -0.93] | **Yes** |
| Diabetes | +0.30 | [-0.30, 0.89] | No |

**Key Finding:** Only smoking shows a statistically significant change during COVID. The 95% confidence interval for smoking is entirely below zero, confirming a real decrease in smoking prevalence during the pandemic. Obesity and diabetes show small, non-significant changes.
